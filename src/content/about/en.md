Hello, I'm Beom-Ku Jung, a software developer with 8 years of experience.

During my military service as a System Operations Officer, I was assigned to develop the unit's website and a barber shop reservation system. 
Although it was unfamiliar at first, I gradually learned and developed these systems through self-study using my smartphone. 
Through this process, I discovered the joy of problem-solving and naturally became fascinated with programming.

After completing my military service, I received Java training through a government-funded program and started my career as a developer by gaining practical experience at a startup. 
Currently, I primarily use TypeScript and am particularly interested in developer-friendly code, type inference, and testing.

## Personal Projects

### [@imhonglu/new-wheels](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/blob/main/README.md)

This project started with the intention of "creating type-safe libraries that match my preferences." 
I'm developing it with the goals of minimizing unnecessary dependencies and achieving high test coverage, focusing on designing libraries with excellent type inference capabilities.
