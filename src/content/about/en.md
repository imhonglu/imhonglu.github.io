Hello, I'm Beom-ku Jung, a software developer with 8 years of experience.

During my military service, I worked as a system operations officer and developed a PHP-based unit homepage and a barbershop reservation system.  
I started coding through self-study on my smartphone, and as I solved problems, I became fascinated with programming.

After completing a government-supported Java training program, I began my career at a startup, gaining hands-on experience.  
Currently, I primarily work with TypeScript, focusing on **improving developer experience through type inference and test automation.**

## Projects

### [@imhonglu/new-wheels](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/blob/main/README_KR.md)

This project started with the idea of **"creating a type-safe library that fits my preferences."**  
The goal is to **minimize unnecessary dependencies and maintain high test coverage** while  
leveraging **TypeScriptâ€™s type system to design safe and intuitive libraries.**

Currently, I am developing the following libraries:

- [@imhonglu/json-schema](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/tree/main/libs/json-schema)  
  A JSON Schema 2020-12 Draft-compliant implementation, validated with the JSON-Schema-test-suite.  
  **Supports schema-based static type inference, enabling a declarative approach to defining safe data structures.**
- [@imhonglu/format](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/tree/main/libs/format)  
  A strongly typed string formatting library compliant with RFC standards.  
  **Provides an API similar to the native JSON API for intuitive usability.**
- [@imhonglu/pattern-builder](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/tree/main/libs/pattern-builder)  
  A RegExp builder that simplifies complex regular expressions.  
  **Enhances readability and makes maintenance easier.**
- [@imhonglu/toolkit](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/tree/main/libs/toolkit)  
  A collection of commonly used utility functions and types to streamline development.  
  **Reduces repetitive code and maintains consistent patterns in TypeScript projects.**
- [@imhonglu/type-guard](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/tree/main/libs/type-guard)  
  A type guard library inspired by Jest matchers, providing a chainable API.  
  **Uses a Proxy-based implementation to minimize overhead while ensuring strong type safety.**
- [@imhonglu/type-object](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/tree/main/libs/type-object)  
  A type-safe wrapper for Object APIs that closely aligns with native behavior.  
  **Enhances safety when working with `Object.keys`, `entries`, `fromEntries`, `hasOwn`, and similar APIs in TypeScript.**
